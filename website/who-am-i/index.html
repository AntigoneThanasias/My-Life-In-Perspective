      <h1>My Biography</h1>
      <p>I never wanted to go to college. I thought I would magically end up on Broadway, performing in my favorite musicals. Things have changed since I was a day dreaming pre-teen, because now I am in college studying communications with a focus in public relations. In my sophomore year at Manhattan College, the experience is not so bad. I won't let my dream of being on Broadway die, I think I'll just put it on hold. For now I am just an average college student, who excessively attends concertsand craves to travel the world.</p>
      <p>On this website you can find out more about me ( I mean if you care). Here you can take a look at my life from my perspective. </p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
      <p>Antigone Thanasias</p>
