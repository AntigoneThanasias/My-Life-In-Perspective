      <h1>My Future Career</h1>
      <p>Currently I am employed in 4 part time jobs on and off campus. On Campus, I am a notetaker, which is a tutor to a student with learning disabilities. Weekly I provide the student notes on whatever the topic was for that session. Off campus I am a babysitter, a waitress, and a tutor. These jobs usually take place on the weekends, soI usually find myself returning home from school. As a tutor I assist students in English and essay structures, and as a babysitter I cater to families within and outside of my neighborhood. Lastly I am a waitress for private events hosted by a country club in Long island. Waitressing is one of the reasons I chose to go into Public Relations. </p>
